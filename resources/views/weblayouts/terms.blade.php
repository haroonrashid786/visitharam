                    <p>Your Financial Protection
                        When you buy an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday from us you
                        will receive an ATOL Certificate.
                    This lists what is financially protected, where
                        you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things
                        go wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the
                        services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases,
                        where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an
                        alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a
                        suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those
                        circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you
                        agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that
                        alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be
                        possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to
                        make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).
                    </p>
                    <p>If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide
                        the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or
                        otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may
                        make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You
                        agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those
                        Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the
                        non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or
                        your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may
                        be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed
                        under the ATOL scheme.
